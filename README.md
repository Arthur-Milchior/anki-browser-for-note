# Browser for note
## Rationale
Most of the time, I want to use the browser to see notes. That is, I
want to change fields, tags, or just look at the informations in my
collection. I usually don't need to see all cards unless I want to
suspend/bury/flag them. This add-on allow you to see only notes
instead of cards.

This used to be a part of the "advanced browser" add-on, but since
2.1.24, it became easy enough to create a separate add-on for it.

## Use

You can switch between note and card mode in the browser by pressing
on Notes > Card/Note. You can use the add-on configuration to
configure the short-cut (by default Alt+Shift+N).
